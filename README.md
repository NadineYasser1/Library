# Library
A Java program with Swing interface to perform all the functions of the library system of an educational institute (e.g. university). 

1-Admin User Interface:
The library has an admin and librarian. The admin can add, view, and delete librarians.

2-Librarian User Interface:
On the other hand, the librarian can (1) add and view books. (2) issue books. (3) View issued books. (4) Return Books.

Notes:
1-The student must borrow from one to 3 books as maximum (the librarian checks it when the student borrows a book) and the librarian decrements the number of books after the issue book operation. 
2-In view issued books the first column id (auto increment id).
3- In Return Book operation (the librarian checks the date if the student returned on the same date, so you should show the message success operation if not you should choose the special financial penalty).
